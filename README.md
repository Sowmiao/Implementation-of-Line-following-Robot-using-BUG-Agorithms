# Implementation-of-Line-following-Robot-using-BUG-Agorithms

OBJECTIVE:
•
•
The Robot must be placed within an obstacle and corresponding to the placement of
the robot a goal must be chosen.
The robot must move according to the bug algorithms: Bug 0, Bug 1, Bug 2. We can
test these algorithms for different start and goal positions.
FLOW OF THE PROJECT:
•
•
•
•
Assembled Robot placed at the desired start point and correspondingly a goal was
selected.
The IR Sensor was tuned in order to implement the Bug Algorithms.
At every regular interval a basic calibration was done to determine the distance to the
goal.
Now the code is designed based on the Calibration and the robot follows the path
according to the code. The code is designed for the different Bug Algorithms (Bug 0,Bug 1, Bug 2). The robot must follow the path according to the Bug algorithms and
must reach their goals.
At every leave point the robot is coded to leave and follow the bug algorithm path to
reach the goal.
Once the goal is reached the Robot must be coded to stop.
